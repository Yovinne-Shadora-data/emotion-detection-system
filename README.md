# Emotion Detection System

This project is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Emotion Detection System** that can classify human emotions from images into 6 categories: **Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Neutral, and Fear**.

## Model Performance

The model was trained on a dataset of **~24,590 images** and validated on **~6,347 images**.  
- **Training Accuracy:** 64%  
- **Validation Accuracy:** 55-56%  

### Accuracy Over Epochs
